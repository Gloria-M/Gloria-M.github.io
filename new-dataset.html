                  From the desire to model as accurate as possible the timeline described by humans when listening to music, emerged the necessity of creating a new dataset, to provide support for recognizing emotions not only from audio features, but also from lyrics and comments features.
                  The annotations are represented by scores in the two dimensions of emotion —valence and arousal— and lists of emotion-related word & count tuples.

Valence, displayed as the horizontal axis, represents the energy of emotion, ranging from positive to negative, while arousal, the vertical axis, represents the amount of intensity in emotion, ranging from low to high. This scheme allows for a division of the emotion space in four quadrants.

                <p class="text-m text-dark">
                  On the page of each track, the corresponding lyrics are identified by the <code class="text-dark">div class_='holder lyric-box'</code> tag and the comments section is announced by the <code class="text-dark">div class_='text'</code> tag.

                  Acquiring the comments from this website comes with an important advantage that diminish the need for additional filtering: the comments are sorted based on the number of votes in descending order with the most voted comment -the most reliable one- listed first. The comments are displayed on multiple pages, but the first one contains just enough comments of good quality, therefore only the data in the first page is collected.

                  Starting with the 18,644 tracks selected by the researchers at Deezer, after performing this procedure and removing the tracks that do not appear on the website or do not have comments associated, the dataset size is reduced to 10,923 samples.

                  Mapping the tracks in the Deezer dataset to the <b>last.fm</b> database by their MSD ID, the social tags recorded in year 2011 can be retrieved. Along each tag associated with each song, a normalized value representing the number of listeners choosing the tag is provided.
                </p>
                <p class="text-m text-dark">
                  In order to create the new dataset with information as up-to-date as possible, instead of querying the 2011 tags database, the tags available at the time of writing are acquired using

                  . This allows access to a maximum of 100 tags per song, sorted by their popularity and the normalized value indicating the count of listeners attributing the respective tag to a song. Using this method, 10,919 tracks with tags are found.

                <p class="text-m text-dark">
                  The considerable volume of tags collected (795,368 unique tags) is extremely noisy and contains lot of unusable data. Therefore, to get to a format which allows mapping to emotions space, a thorough cleaning process must be performed. The musical genre, instruments names or similarity tags, along many others, are removed following the removal criteria presented, reducing the volume of social tags to 390,698:
                  <ul class="text-m text-dark">
                    <li>tags containing artist name</li>

                <p class="text-m text-dark">
                  In order to select the tags akin to an emotion descriptor, a list of affect-related words must first be composed. For this process, the affective lexicon WordNet Affect

                <p class="text-m text-dark">
                  Before going further, words related to emotions, but which, in the context of social tags, could have ambiguous or judgmental meaning are removed from the list, as suggested in
                  <a class="dataset-link text-m" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Lyric-Text-Mining-in-Music-Mood-Classification-Hu-Downie/e658ec86e033aae370ba680118a04431071cafe1" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">

                  . Therefore, appreciation remarks such as <em>'awesome', 'bad', 'fantastic', 'good', 'great', 'horrible'</em> which refer to the quality of music and preference words like <em>'adore', 'like', 'love', 'hate'</em> which might lead to ambiguous interpretations, are removed from the list of emotion-related words.
                </p>
                <p class="text-m text-dark">
                  In order to include all possible forms of the emotion-related words, they are stemmed to a root using the Porter Stemmer functionality provided in the

                  </a>
                  . By searching tags containing these stems, they are also grouped, according to the stems' membership in the emotions clusters, discarding the tags not containing any of the stems of the emotion-related words. Following, a manual selection of tags is performed, as not all tags containing stems of affective words describe an emotion perceived when listening to a particular song. Tags that could, at the same time, be mapped to a positive emotion and to a negative emotion are identified and removed. Some of these tags with ambiguous meaning found are <em>'to listen when sad', 'to listen when happy', 'music for sad days', music for when you feel down'</em>.

                <p class="text-m text-dark">
                  After this curation phase, each song has its remained tags replaced by the emotion words describing the clusters the tags are part of. It is important to mention that the normalized values associated with each tag at song-level, are taking into account when mapping the tags to valence and arousal values. At this stage, after removing the songs without at least one tag with affective information, the dataset size is reduced to 10,579 samples. Therefore, for each song, the tags are transformed into the words describing the emotions clusters, keeping their corresponding normalized count. In the case when more tags are mapped to the same word, the normalized count of the representative word is obtained by summing the values of the tags.

The annotators were presented with groups of 4 words from which, besides assigning real values of emotion dimensions, they had to choose two words following a  Best-Worst Scaling technique.

                  The raw lyrics data contain a great amount of noise, as they are written by different users on <em>https://songmeanings.com/</em>, with no set of rules or format to be followed. Therefore, cleaning the lyrics data is a meticulous process that involves manual curating and a considerable amount of time. The lyrics have a particular structure, different than usual text data. Hence, before applying cleaning procedures commonly used in **NLP** tasks, this structure is studied for patterns identification with the scope of finding a set of rule that allow for automatization.

                  As a result of a series of manual transformations and removals, different types of patterns are revealed and used for automatization of the cleaning process.
                  In differentiating between the types of patterns discovered, the <em>newline</em> (\n) character has the greatest role.
                  The most important patterns are ones playing a role in changing the text of lyrics, as described below:
                </p>

                <div class="proj-img-holder">
                  <img src="images\lyrics_repetition_patterns.png" width=90%>
                </div>

                <p class="text-m text-dark">
                  The structural instructions are another class of patterns discovered, with no relevance for the strategy chosen in recognizing emotions in music, therefore are removed from the lyrics text. They may contain tags present in the important patterns mentioned earlier, but in different configurations, as defined by the occurrence of the <em>newline</em> character.
                </p>

                <div class="proj-img-holder">
                  <img src="images\lyrics_structural_patterns.png" width=90%>
                </div>

                <p class="text-m text-dark">
                  These transformations bring the lyrics text to a format that allows applying common preprocessing techniques used in NLP tasks.
                </p>

                <div class="sect-title-space">
                  <h4 id="S7" class="text-dark text-section">
                    Lyrics and Comments preprocessing

                </div>
                <div class="sect-title-sep"></div>

                <p class="text-m text-dark">
                  Starting with the texts in <em>string</em> format, the following transformations are applied:
                  <ul class="text-m text-dark">
                    <li>
                      replace words in short form with their extended forms <br>
                      - 'm &#8594 am <br>
                      - 're &#8594 are <br>
                      - 've &#8594 have <br>
                      - 'd &#8594 would <br>
                      - 'll &#8594 will <br>
                      - she's &#8594 she is <br>
                      - he's &#8594 he is <br>
                      - it's &#8594 it is <br>
                      - ain't &#8594 is not <br>
                      - n't &#8594 n not <br>
                      - n' &#8594 ng <br>
                      - 's &#8594 ''
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      remove punctuation symbols (<em>' . ' , ' , ' , ' ; ' , '!', '', '*'</em>, etc.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      remove spacing instructions (<em>'\n', '\t'</em>)
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="text-m text-dark">
                  The steps presented above conclude with tokenization, converting the texts into lists of words. The preprocessing phase ends after curating the words resulted, as follows:
                  <ul class="text-m text-dark">
                    <li>
                      correct identified misspellings (*'urself', 'thered'*, etc.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      replace censored words with their uncensored version
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      remove stopwords
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      discard non-english words, using
